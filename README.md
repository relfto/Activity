# Activity

Hello everyone ,about project:
1)So,this is to demonstrate navigation between activities

2)Here,I have navigate from single screen doing counter related task  and having navigate button to GridCardLayout View,by clicking on navigate button.

3)Having Pictures of Cars

4)Inside gridcardview,I have also added onClick on pictures.

5)So,by clicking on it some functionality is processed,

6)You can check this out in SecondActivity.kt named file.


So,that's it a small demonstration of navigation as beginner.

Exceptional task can be done:
Nothing great,but data sharing.i.e, sharing counter value to grid layout screen and displaying it.
